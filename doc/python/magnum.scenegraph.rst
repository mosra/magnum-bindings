.. py:module:: magnum.scenegraph

    The Python API for :dox:`SceneGraph` provides, similarly to C++, multiple
    different transformation implementations. Recommended usage is importing
    desired implementation akin to :cpp:`typedef`\ ing the types in C++:

    .. code-figure::

        .. code:: c++

            #include <Magnum/SceneGraph/Object.h>
            #include <Magnum/SceneGraph/Scene.h>
            #include <Magnum/SceneGraph/MatrixTransformation3D.h>

            typedef SceneGraph::Scene<SceneGraph::MatrixTransformation3D> Scene3D;
            typedef SceneGraph::Object<SceneGraph::MatrixTransformation3D> Object3D;

        C++

    .. code-figure::

        .. code:: py

            from magnum import scenegraph
            from magnum.scenegraph.matrix import Scene3D, Object3D

        Python

    `Scene vs Object`_
    ==================

    In C++, the Scene is a subclass of Object. However, because the Scene
    object is not transformable nor it's possible to attach features to it,
    most of the inherited API is unusable. This could be considered a wart of
    the C++ API, so the Python bindings expose Scene and Object as two
    unrelated types and all APIs that can take either a Scene or an Object
    have corresponding overloads.

    `Reference counting`_
    =====================

    Compared to C++, the following is done with all Object instances created
    on Python side:

    -   the object is additionally referenced by its parent (if there's any)
        so objects created in local scope stay alive even after exiting the
        scope
    -   deleting its parent (either due to it going out of scope or using
        :py:`del` in Python) will cause it to have no parent instead of being
        cascade deleted (unless it's not referenced anymore, in which case it's deleted as well)
    -   in order to actually destroy an object, it has to have no parent

    For features it's slightly different:

    -   the feature is additionally referenced by the holder object so features
        created in local scope stay alive even after exiting the scope
    -   deleting the holder object (either due to it going out of scope
        or using :py:`del` in Python) will cause it to be without a holder
        object (unless it's not referenced anymore, in which case it's deleted
        as well) --- this makes any further operations on it impossible and
        likely dangerous
    -   in order to actually destroy a feature, it has to have no holder object
