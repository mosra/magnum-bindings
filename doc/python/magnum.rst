    `Memory ownership and reference counting`_
    ==========================================

    Similarly to :ref:`corrade.containers.ArrayView` (and unlike in C++), the
    view keeps a reference to the original memory owner object in the
    :ref:`owner` field, meaning that calling :py:`del` on the original object
    will *not* invalidate the view. Slicing a view creates a new view
    referencing the same original object, without any dependency on the
    previous view. That means a long chained slicing operation will not cause
    increased memory usage.

    The :ref:`owner` is :py:`None` if the view is empty.

    `Pixel data access`_
    ====================

    The class makes use of Python's dynamic nature and provides direct access
    to pixel data in their concrete types via :ref:`pixels`. The returned views
    point to the underlying image data, element access coverts to a type
    corresponding to a particular :ref:`PixelFormat` and for
    performance-oriented access the view implements a buffer protocol with a
    corresponding type annotation.

    Normalized formats (such as :ref:`PixelFormat.RGB8_UNORM` but also
    :ref:`PixelFormat.RGBA8_SRGB`) are unpacked to a corresponding
    floating-point representation in element access and packed from a
    floating-point representation in mutable acess. The type annotation is
    however still matching the original type (such as :py:`'3B'` / :py:`'4B'`
    in these cases), so code consuming these via the buffer protocol needs to
    handle the normalization explicitly if needed.
