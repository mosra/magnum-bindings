Magnum Python bindings
######################

*Lightweight and modular graphics middleware for games and data visualization.*

This site documents the Python bindings for the Magnum project. To see
high-level feature overview, project goals or read the developer blog, head
over to the `project homepage <https://magnum.graphics>`_.

`Getting started`_
==================

Because it's out of human capabilities to maintain the Python documentation at
the same scale as the C++ documentation including all math equations, best
practices and such, most of the Python documentation is written as a delta to
the C++ docs --- highlighting important differences and describing general
conventions, but referring to documentation of underlying C++ APIs for all
details.

See the :ref:`building docs <std:doc:building>` for an installation guide,
:ref:`API convention documentation <std:doc:api-conventions>` and
:ref:`documentation of each module <std:special:modules>` for more information about
the actual usage. There are also :ref:`examples <std:doc:examples>` to give you
an idea about how the API feels.
