    people and organizations that contributed to Magnum Python Bindings.

`Third-party components`_
=========================

.. TODO: ffs doxygen SORT YOUR SHIT OUT, why can't I link to
    credits-third-party?!
.. role:: doxygen-you-fool(link)
    :class: m-doc-external

While Magnum Python Bindings themselves don't depend on much, a lot of
third-party components is used transitively from the Magnum C++ implementation.
Please see the :ref:`main page <std:doc:index#license>` for license of Magnum
Python Bindings themselves and the
:doxygen-you-fool:`Third-party components <https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/credits-third-party.html>`
page of C++ docs for a detailed overview of all used components. The list below
uses the same color-coding scheme for easier overview:

:ref:`Magnum Python Bindings <std:doc:index>`
    Bindings generated with :gh:`pybind11 <pybind/pybind11>`, released under a
    :label-success:`BSD-style license`
    (`license text <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/blob/master/LICENSE>`_,
    `choosealicense.com <https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/>`_).
    It requires attribution for public use.

`Contributors`_
===============

Listing only people with code contributions or other significant work, because
otherwise there's too many :) There's also a
:dox:`similar list for Corrade <corrade-credits-contributors>` and
:dox:`Magnum <credits-contributors>` themselves. Big thanks to everyone
involved!
