Python API conventions
######################

:summary: Basic rules and good practices for both Python binding developers and
    users.
:ref-prefix:
    corrade
    magnum

`API naming`_
=============

-   mapping is made as clear as possible, the user should not need assistance
    to know what's the corresponding name in Python
-   modules ``lowercase``, words *not* separated with underscores (which means
    C++ namespaces have to be named clearly and tersely to make this possible)
-   class names ``CamelCase``
-   function names ``snake_case``
-   constants and enums ``UPPERCASE``, again underscores omitted if it doesn't
    hurt readability

`Preprocessor definitions`_
---------------------------

Exposed to Python as plain boolean constants, and only those that actually are
useful in a Python setting.

=============================================================== ===========

`Enums`_
--------

Custom construction helpers for enums are converted to functions directly on
the Python enum class.

.. class:: m-table

C++                                            Python

:dox:`MeshPrimitive::TriangleStrip`            :ref:`MeshPrimitive.TRIANGLE_STRIP`
:dox:`Trade::meshAttributeCustom()`            :ref:`trade.MeshAttribute.CUSTOM() <trade.MeshAttribute>`
:dox:`Trade::isMeshAttributeCustom()`          :ref:`trade.MeshAttribute.is_custom <trade.MeshAttribute>`
============================================== ============================

`Enum sets`_
------------

Compared to C++, there's just one enum type with a plural name, and it contains
both the values and binary operators. Additionally, there's an explicit
``NONE`` value for an empty set.

.. class:: m-table

============================================== ============================
C++                                            Python
============================================== ============================
:dox:`Trade::DataFlag::Mutable`                :ref:`trade.DataFlags.MUTABLE`
:dox:`Trade::DataFlags{} <Trade::DataFlags>`   :ref:`trade.DataFlags.NONE`
============================================== ============================

`Constants`_
------------

Apart from :dox:`Math::Constants`, which are exposed directly as members of the
:ref:`magnum.math` submodule to mimic Python's :ref:`math`, most of the
constants used throughout the C++ API are related to templates. Those are,
where applicable, converted to Python builtins such as :py:`len()`.

.. class:: m-table

============================================== ============================
C++                                            Python
============================================== ============================
:dox:`Constants::pi() <Math::Constants::pi()>` :ref:`math.pi <magnum.math.pi>`
:dox:`Math::Vector::Size`                      :py:`len(vec)`
============================================== ============================

`Initialization tags`_
----------------------

Since overloading based on argument types is not a common thing to do in Python
(and it adds extra overhead in pybind11), all initialization tags are converted
to static constructors instead:

.. container:: m-row

    .. container:: m-col-m-6

        .. code-figure::

            .. code:: c++

                Matrix4 a{Math::IdentityInit, 5.0f};
                GL::Buffer b{NoCreate};

            C++

    .. container:: m-col-m-6

        .. code-figure::

            .. code:: py

                a = Matrix4.identity_init(5.0)
                b = gl.Buffer.no_create()

            Python

There's no equivalent for the :dox:`Math::NoInit <Math::NoInitT>` tag, as
such optimization doesn't make much sense when instances are copied back
and forth between C++ and Python. Similarly, the :dox:`NoCreate <NoCreateT>`
tag makes sense only in C++ which differentiates between stack-allocated and
heap-allocated instances. In Python it's enough to simply set an instance to
:py:`None` to achieve the same effect.

`Name import conventions`_
==========================

Similarly to C++, where it's encouraged to do something like

.. code:: c++

    namespace YourProject {
        using namespace Magnum;
    }

and then use Magnum C++ APIs unprefixed from inside that namespace, the
recommended Python workflow is similar. Note that importing the root module
*does not* import submodules, so you are expected to import those on an
as-needed basis as well.

.. code:: py

    from magnum import *
    from magnum import gl, platform

In particular, both the C++ and the Python API is designed in a way to prevent
too generic or confusing names in the root namespace / module and also keeping
it relatively clean and small, without too many symbols. On the other hand, the
subnamespaces *do* have generic names. The :dox:`GL::version()` /
:ref:`gl.version()` API is one example --- it's tucked in a subnamespace so the
generic name isn't a problem, but you wouldn't find anything of similar
genericity in the root namespace / module.

An exception to this rule is exposed preprocessor definitions --- these are
*not* pulled in when doing :py:`from magnum import *` as this would likely
cause conflicts (in particular, :ref:`BUILD_STATIC` is defined by Corrade as
well). Instead, you have to access them like this:

.. code:: py

    import magnum

    if magnum.TARGET_GLES2:
        format = gl.TextureFormat.RGBA8
    else:
        format = gl.TextureFormat.R8

`Handling of alternate implementations`_
----------------------------------------

C++ APIs that have alternative implementations (such as
:dox:`Platform::Sdl2Application` vs. :dox:`Platform::GlfwApplication`, or
:dox:`SceneGraph::MatrixTransformation3D` vs.
:dox:`SceneGraph::TranslationRotationScalingTransformation3D`) either provide
:cpp:`typedef`\ s based on what header you include or require you to
:cpp:`typedef` them yourselves:

.. code:: c++

    class MyApplication: Platform::Application {}; // depends on what you include

    typedef SceneGraph::Object<SceneGraph::MatrixTransformation3D> Object3D;

In Python, the alternate implementations are tucked in submodules (such as
:ref:`platform.sdl2` vs. :ref:`platform.glfw`, or :ref:`scenegraph.matrix` vs.
:ref:`scenegraph.trs`), each submodule providing the same names (such as
:ref:`Application <platform.sdl2.Application>` or
:ref:`Object3D <scenegraph.matrix.Object3D>`)
and the designed way to use them is via :py:`from ... import`:

.. code:: py

    from magnum.platform.sdl2 import Application
    from magnum.scenegraph.trs import Scene3D, Object3D

`Basic guarantees`_
===================

-   All types printable using :dox:`Utility::Debug` implement :py:`__repr__()`
    on the Python side, producing the exact same output.
