.. py:module:: magnum.platform

    Concrete implementations of :py:`Application` and :py:`WindowlessApplication`
    classes are available in submodules, and it's up to you which one you
    choose. For example:

    .. code:: py

        from magnum import platform
        import magnum.platform.sdl2

        class MyApp(platform.sdl2.Application):
            ...

    The same goes for :py:`WindowlessApplication` implementations, for example:

    .. code:: py

        from magnum import platform
        import magnum.platform.egl

        class MyApp(platform.egl.WindowlessApplication):
            ...

    Alternatively, if you want to narrow down the mention of a particular
    toolkit to just one line, you can also do:

    .. code:: py

        from magnum.platform.sdl2 import Application

        class MyApp(Application):
