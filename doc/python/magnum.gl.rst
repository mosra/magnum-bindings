    :TODO: remove this line once m.css stops ignoring first caption on a page

    `NoCreate constructors`_
    ========================

    .. TODO: link to NoCreate once m.dox handles variables properly

    Compared to C++, the Python APIs don't have an alternative to the
    :dox:`NoCreate <NoCreateT>` constructor tag. In C++ these make it possible
    to have class members initialized before a GL context is present, but in
    Python there's no such limitation so these don't make sense.

.. py:function:: magnum.gl.AbstractShaderProgram.link
    :raise RuntimeError: If linking fails
.. py:function:: magnum.gl.AbstractShaderProgram.uniform_location
    :raise ValueError: If there's no uniform of that name

    `Buffer ownership and reference counting`_
    ==========================================

    Unlike in C++, where a :dox:`GL::Buffer` is either :dox:`std::move()`\ d
    into the mesh or referenced externally (with the user being responsible for
    its lifetime), the :ref:`gl.Mesh` object keeps references to all buffers
    added to it.

.. py:property:: magnum.gl.Mesh.primitive

    While querying this property will always give back a :ref:`gl.MeshPrimitive`,
    this property can be set using either :ref:`magnum.MeshPrimitive` or
    :ref:`gl.MeshPrimitive`, similarly to how the overloaded
    :dox:`GL::Mesh::setPrimitive()` works.

.. py:property:: magnum.gl.Texture1D.minification_filter

    See :ref:`Texture2D.minification_filter` for more information.

.. py:property:: magnum.gl.Texture2D.minification_filter

    This property accepts either a tuple of :ref:`magnum.SamplerFilter` /
    :ref:`gl.SamplerFilter` and :ref:`magnum.SamplerMipmap` /
    :ref:`gl.SamplerMipmap` values or just :ref:`magnum.SamplerFilter` / :ref:`gl.SamplerFilter` alone in which case :ref:`gl.SamplerMipmap.BASE`
    will be used implicitly; similarly to how the overloaded
    :dox:`GL::Texture::setMinificationFilter()` works.

.. py:property:: magnum.gl.Texture3D.minification_filter

    See :ref:`Texture2D.minification_filter` for more information.

.. py:property:: magnum.gl.Texture1D.magnification_filter

    See :ref:`Texture2D.magnification_filter` for more information.

.. py:property:: magnum.gl.Texture2D.magnification_filter

    works.
