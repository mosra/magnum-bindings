# Find Magnum bindings
# --------------------
#
# Finds helper headers for the Magnum bindings. Basic usage::
#
#  find_package(MagnumBindings REQUIRED)
#
# This command tries to find Magnum bindings and then defines the following:
#
#  MagnumBindings_FOUND         - Whether Magnum bindings were found
#
# This command will not try to find any actual bindings. The bindings are:
#
#  Python                       - Python bindings
#
# Example usage with specifying the components is::
#
#  find_package(MagnumBindings REQUIRED Python)
#
# For each component is then defined:
#
#  MagnumBindings_*_FOUND       - Whether the bindings were found
#  MagnumBindings::*            - Imported target
#
# The package is found if the headers are found. None of the bindings expose
# any library at the moment.
#
# Additionally these variables are defined for internal usage:
#
#  MAGNUMBINDINGS_INCLUDE_DIR   - Magnum bindings include dir (w/o dependencies)
#

# generated inside the build dir so this won't find it, instead
# src/CMakeLists.txt forcibly sets MAGNUMBINDINGS_INCLUDE_DIR as an internal
