/* This is a variant of https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/issues/1389. If the
   object has a parent, its refcount gets increased in order to avoid it being
   deleted by Python too soon. The refcount gets decreased when the parent is
   removed again or the parent gets deleted. I thought this would be doable
   inside py::init() as

    .def(py::init([](SceneGraph::Scene<Transformation>* parent) {
        auto self = new PyObject<Transformation>{parent};
        if(parent) py::cast(self).inc_ref();
        return self;
    }))

   but FOR SOME REASON py::cast(self) inside py::init() returns a different
   underlying PyObject pointer, so it only leads to crashes. */
