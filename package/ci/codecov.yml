fixes:
# The src/python/magnum/__init__.py is copied to cmake's build dir together
# with setup.py next to the C++ binaries and the test is done from here.
# Python's coverage.py reports an absolute path to it, which means a simple
# "build/src/python/::src/python/" won't suffice. This is hardcoded to CircleCI
# Linux / macOS and AppVeyor build paths so let's hope these won't change.
